            <h3>Self tought web and Java developer</h3>

            <p> I am a full time business professional working in a renowned corporate house.
                I have been learning web development and android/Java
                programming during my leisure time. I think this is a good investment
                of my time as it prepares me for the upcoming world. I beleive
                that in future every one will have to learn atleast some coding. Also, i find
                it very satisfying to learn something new instead of wasting time on social media. 
            </p>
